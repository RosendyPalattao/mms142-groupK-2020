Online Advertisements have come a long way. From annoying, irrelevant advertisements to less obtrusive ads with relatable content, advertisers continue to find ways that are more acceptable and appealing to their targeted audience. Because of this innovation, the return of investment from online advertising continues to increase. As a result, more businesses are transitioning and investing most of their marketing budgets to digital marketing.

                            Goran Dautovic mentions that “Social media advertising budgets have doubled worldwide, from $16 billion in 2014 to $31 billion in 2016.” (2020). Along with this is the report that, in 2018, brands were found to be “devoting 33 percent of ad spend to digital platforms—up from 25 percent in 2014.” (Gigante, 2018) These trends show how rapid the increase of online advertising has become in the span of a few years.

Traditional print (newspapers and magazines) spending is a close second, which will drop nearly 18%. Overall, traditional ad spending’s share in the US will drop to 45.8% in 2019, from 51.4% last year.” (2019).

                            The Financial Times, one of the world's leading news organizations based in the UK, established back in 1888 has now reached a million paying readers. The company is one of the first newspapers to introduce a paywall on their website back in 2002, instead of uploading their award winning and trusted journalism for free on the internet, they adapted to the rapidly changing environment for news media and changed the paper's business model, besides  making their journalism subscription based which is the core of their strategy, they also have four other main revenue generators which would be print advertising, print circulation and conferences. They have reduced the number or printing sites but did not eliminate print production, it is through digital advertising that they are able to close on the value of print advertising.

Online advertising has greatly affected the traditional media in terms of production, marketing and distribution as online and download becomes the mode of delivery.

                            In 2019, according to the data from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, advertising is no longer the news publishers’ main source of revenue, they now focus on subscription income, with ads just playing a supporting role, they now know that reader revenue is greater than advertising unlike when they have first started print production.

                    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1">
                            <h3 class="mb-0">POSITIVE EFFECT</h3>
                            <p>With the drastic changes that the internet has brought about to the advertising industry came the changes within these systems of which continuously occur as new technologies and platforms are invented. </p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">1. Cost Efficient</div>
                            <div>Creative solutions on how to be cost-efficient will lead to coming out of this pandemic, stronger than before. This is a unique time for advertisers where we on one side may be moving toward a recession and on the other side have more people online willing to consume online services and products. </div>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">2. Direct communication channels.</div>
                            <div>Traditional advertising was broadcasted to customers but didn't listen to them – clients were only recipients of their messages. These days the rules have changed, we now receive the company's messages and we can ask for more information, or complain about something related to their product or service. After all, great customer service is one of the most powerful advertising methods when utilized properly and efficiently.</div>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">3. Data Understands Consumer's Needs</div>
                            <div>In Search Engine Marketing, a big chunk of consumer data is stored and is used so the company can understand the consumer's buying journey.  The data is used to their advantage and with an increased access to consumers, they are able to establish a connection with them before a purchase can be made.</div>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">4. Markets are Directly Targeted</div>
                            <div>Online advertising allows a company to choose the market it serves. If you're a sneakerhead, there are algorithms used to directly show you what you want based on what you searched for. </div>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">5. Data Analytics </div>
                            <div>There are numbers to tell if your campaign is a flop or a hit. There's a saying goes if you can measure it, you can achieve it. Data analytics can give you an overall information about the consumers, your brand, or even the market you're catering.</div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1">
                            <h3 class="mb-0">NEGATIVE EFFECT</h3>
                            <p>On the back of every innovation rides threats and dangers. The digital interface is now awash with advertising that frustrates users hence, fueling a hostile and untrusting attitude towards advertising as a whole.
</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">1. DAMAGE TO THE TYPICAL USER EXPERIENCE</div>
                            <div>Ads are increasingly interrupting the viewing patterns of its viewers –– desperately gnawing at us not to inspire, but to command our attention. Unlike before, internet users are now forced to endure watching (sometimes numerous) ads at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of online content such as videos found on youtube and Facebook or before accessing online services such as citation machines.</div>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">2. Consumers risk exposure to malware through everyday activity.</div>
                            <div>Consumers can incur malware attacks by simply visiting a website and without taking any action such as clicking an advertisement.  The complexity of online advertising makes it impossible for consumers to avoid advertising malware attacks or identify the source of the malware exposure and determine whether the ad network or host website could have prevented the attack.</div>
